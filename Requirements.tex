\section{DAPHNE Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
The next constraints are considered mandatory for the design:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Signal-to-noise > 4 			(SP-PDS-14)
    \item < 1 us time resolution 		(SP-FD-4)
    \item < 1 kHZ dark noise rate 		(SP-PDS-15)
    \item 2000 PE dynamic range 		(SP-PDS-16)
\end{itemize}
Moreover, the next design constraints are considered for granularity, space in the cryostat inteface, and in order to warrantee signal description:
\begin{itemize}
\item 40 Channel granularity
\item 14 bit resolution
\item 65 MSPS
\item High SNR
\item Power supply for the active ganging
\item Increase the bandwidth of the output (4.8Gb/s)
\end{itemize}
\newpage
“The quantitative requirements for the system are driven by many FD level specifications that affect signal size sensitivity, signal to noise (S/N), timing resolution, event size and data transfer limits from the DAQ, power needs and dissipation limits, channel density and channel count, and cost.”

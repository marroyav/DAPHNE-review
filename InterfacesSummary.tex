After checking the status of the DAPHNE interfaces there are still open points to be defined:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Floating or non-floating power supply for the cold amplifier.
    \item External power supply.
    \item To final definition of DAPHNE cable a detailed scheme of PDS-Flange is needed to check for available space.
    \item Error handling in agreement with other groups and Slow Control
\end{enumerate}
